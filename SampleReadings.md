Option 1: Louis de Bernières, Captain Corelli’s Mandolin

Love is a temporary madness,
It erupts like volcanoes and then subsides.
And when it subsides you have to make a decision.
You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together
That it is inconceivable that you should ever part.
Because this is what love is.
Love is not breathlessness,
It is not excitement,
It is not the promulgation of eternal passion.
That is just being “in love” which any fool can do.
Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away,
And this is both an art and a fortunate accident.
Those that truly love, have roots that grow towards each other underground,
And when all the pretty blossoms have fallen from their branches,
They find that they are one tree and not two.

Option 2: Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer

I want to make you smile whenever you’re sad.
Carry you around when your arthritis is bad.
All I want to do is grow old with you.
I’ll get your medicine when your tummy aches.
Build you a fire if the furnace breaks.
Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you.
I’ll miss you, kiss you, give you my coat when you are cold.
Need you, feed you, even let you hold the remote control.
So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink.
Put you to bed if you’ve had too much to drink.
I could be the man who grows old with you.
I want to grow old with you.

Option 3: Letter from Johnny Cash to June Carter (with some minor edits…)

We get old and get used to each other. We think alike. we read each others’ minds. We know what the other wants without asking. Sometimes we irritate each other a little bit, sometimes a lot.

Maybe sometimes we take each other for granted. But once in a while, like today, I meditate on it and realize how lucky I am to share my life with the person woven into it.

Option 4: Apache Wedding Blessing

Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be shelter for the other. 
Now you will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other.
Now there will be no loneliness, for each of you will be companion to the other.
Now you are two persons, but there is only one life before you.
May beauty surround you both in the journey ahead and through all the years.
May happiness be your companion and your days together be good and long upon the earth.
