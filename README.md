## Introduction and Welcome

*(Optional wedding crashers reference:)* Welcome! If you're a Wedding Crashers fan and wondered what you like better, Christmas or Wedding Season, well, today is Dan and Jacqui's gift to you.

*(To guests:)* On behalf of Jacqui and Dan, thank you for being here today and for supporting them over the years. They have built a lasting and proven friendship, the kind of relationship we recognize today as a marriage. They have chosen to share this moment with all of us, so we can witness, acknowledge, and celebrate the familiar and awesome triumph of love, patience, forgiveness, and friendship above all else. As witnesses, we show our intent to support Dan and Jacqui for the years to come. 

*(To couple:)* Dan and Jacqui, thank you for inviting us to celebrate the love that has grown between you, deeper and more meaningful as the years have gone by. The kind of partnership you have is built on more than love. I have seen the ever-expanding empathy, creativity, and the generous sense of humor that has gone into it and made it stronger. Besides watching The Wedding Crashers to prepare for today, I also resonated with this phrase from Kermit the Frog's TedX Talk. Loving relationships are built on a kind of ridiculous optimism, and it's the kind of dream that gets better the more people you share it with.

*(To guests:)* We will now have the reading, from The Wedding Singer, performed by Paul Carr.

## Reading

```
I want to make you smile whenever you're sad,
carry you around when your arthritis is bad.
All I want to do, is grow old with you.

I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches,
build you a fire if the furnace breaks.
Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you.

I'll miss you, kiss you, give you my coat when you are cold.
Need you, feed you, even let you hold the remote control.

So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink,
put you to bed if you've had too much to drink.
I could be the man, who grows old with you.
I want to be the man, who grows old with you.
```

## Declaration of Intent

*(To couple:)* Please join hands. 

*(To Dan:)* Dan, do you take Jacqui to be your lawfully wedding wife to share your life with? Will you love her, laugh with her, comfort her, honor and defend her, and be true to her above all else?

*(Dan to Jacqui:)* I do.

*(To Jacqui:)* Jacqui, do you take Dan to be your lawfully wedded husband to share your life with? Will you love him, laugh with him, comfort him, honor and defend him, and be true to him above all else?

*(Jacqui:)* I do.

## Exchange of Rings

*(To guests:)* Couples have exchanged rings as a symbol of commitment to each other for thousands of years. With no beginning and no end, the circle is a symbol of eternity. Allow these rings to serve as a symbol of your love's history, present, and future.

*(To Jacqui:)* Jacqui, please repeat after me: *Dan, I give you this ring as a symbol of my undying love for you. With it, I promise to love you, cherish you, and stand by you in good times and bad, sickness and health, for as long as I live.*

*Jacqui places ring on Dan's finger*

*(To Dan:)* Dan, please repeat after me. *Jacqui, I give you this ring as a symbol of my undying love for you. With it, I promise to love you, cherish you, and stand by you in good times and bad, sickness and health, for as long as I live.*

## Salt Ritual (optional)

*(To guests):* Salt has been used as a preservative and purifier to prevent decay and corruption since ancient times. It is the symbol of Godâ€™s character and dependability because it is eternal, enduring, never changing, and abiding eternally. 

*(To couple):* Jacqui and Dan, a vial of salt stands before each of you, symbolizing your individuality as well as your aspirations, goals, desires, and intentions for this marriage and the family you have become. You create a Covenant by blending your salt together, symbolizing your joining in marriage and as one family.

*(To couple):* Dan and Jacqui, at this time, I ask each of you to lift your salt and blend them together.

*(To couple):* This salt exchange symbolizes the intertwining of your lives. You will be as difficult to come between as it would be to separate these grains of salt. This visual representation of your intentions for each other is as beautiful as it is eternal. No matter what life brings, this beautiful relationship is a shared and integral part of your journey through it.

## Pronouncement

*(To couple:)* At this time, I would like to share a wish for you both. My wish is you always find the strength to love and care for yourselves with radical empathy and ridiculous optimism and you continue to cultivate the support of your friends and family, which is as much a gift to us as we hope it is for you. No one person needs to be everything to us in all phases of our lives. May you be surrounded by the support and love shown here today for all the years to come.

*(To couple:)* At that's it! By the power vested in me by the Universal Life Church Ministries and the American Marriage Ministries, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss!
