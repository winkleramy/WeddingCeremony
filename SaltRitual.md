Salt Ritual (optional)

(To guests): Salt has been used as a preservative and purifier to prevent decay and corruption since ancient times. It is the symbol of Godâ€™s character and dependability because it is eternal, enduring, never changing, and abiding eternally. 

(To couple): Jacqui and Dan, a vial of salt stands before each of you, symbolizing your individuality as well as your aspirations, goals, desires, and intentions for this marriage and the family you have become. You create a Covenant by blending your salt together, symbolizing your joining in marriage and as one family.

(To couple): Dan and Jacqui, at this time, I ask each of you to lift your salt and blend them together.

(To couple): This salt exchange symbolizes the intertwining of your lives. You will be as difficult to come between as it would be to separate these grains of salt. This visual representation of your intentions for each other is as beautiful as it is eternal. No matter what life brings, this beautiful relationship is a shared and integral part of your journey through it.
