# Wedding Ceremony for Jacqui Dodge and Daniel Winkler

#### General Questions
- Do you prefer to be referred to as "husband and wife", as "partners", or as "spouses"?
- Would you like any specific thank-yous or acknowledges made by me on your behalf at the beginning of the ceremony?
- Do you have any reading, poem, or song preference for the "reading" section of the ceremony? Who would you like to perform the reading?
- Would you like to combine the vows and ring exchange or keep them separate?
- Would you like to customize the vows and/or ring exchange wording?
- Would you like to specify who goes first for each section? By default, I'll alternate who goes first for the declaration of intent, vows, and rings.
- Would you like to include any extra rituals, such as a candle or salt ritual?

## Introduction and Welcome

*optional wedding crashers reference:* Welcome! If you're a wedding crashers fan and asked yourself what you like better, Christmas or Wedding Season, well, today is Dan and Jacqui's gift to you.

*to guests:* On behalf of the happy couple, thank you for being here today and for supporting Jacqui and Dan over the years. They have built a lasting and proven friendship, the kind of relationship we now recognize as a marriage. And as witnesses here today, we show our intention to support Dan and Jacqui for the years to come.

*to couple:* Dan and Jacqui, thank you for inviting us all here today to celebrate the love that has grown between you, deeper and richer and more meaningful as the years have gone by. The kind of partnership you have is built on more than love. I have seen the ever-expanding empathy and creativity and the generous sense of humor that has gone into it and made it stronger. Besides watching The Wedding Crashers to prepare for this day, I also resonated with this phrase from Kermit the Frog's TedX Talk.  to our relationships sometimes takes ridiculous optimism. I imagine this is what others refer to when they talk about a leap of faith. And for a Frog, a leap can be quite a long way.
