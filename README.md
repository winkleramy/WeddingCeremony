## Introduction and Welcome

*(To guests:)* Welcome! On behalf of the couple, thank you for being here today and for supporting Jacqui and Dan over the years. Like a wizard, a wedding is never late, or early, it arrives precisely when it means to. 

*(To couple:)* Dan and Jacqui, thank you for inviting us to celebrate with the love that has grown between you, deeper and more meaningful as the years have gone by, building this relationship that we recognize today as a marriage. The kind of partnership you have is built on more than love. We see between you the ever-expanding empathy and the generous sense of humor that has gone into your relationship and made it stronger. As Kermit also says, maybe you don't need the whole world to love you. Maybe you just need one person. One ridiculously optimistic person. May you always be each other's person.

## First Reading

Marry your best friend. 
Marry someone who you wouldn’t mind waking up to every day for the rest of your life. 
The one who makes you feel glad to be alive. 
Marry someone who drives you crazy, who frustrates you, but the one who calms you. 
Marry the one who you don’t mind fighting with because they will be fair about it. 
Don’t marry someone who gives their ego more importance than they give you. 
Marry someone who makes you the best version of yourself. 
The one who believes in you, even when you don’t. 
The one who stands by you through thick and thin. Marry someone you can’t imagine your life without.

## Second Reading

They say that sometimes love starts with a spark, and that might be true. 
But if I were to wish you a love, I wouldn’t wish fire for you. 
You see, fire is powerful. It burns bright and then it’s gone. 
It’s beautiful and warm, but it doesn’t last long. 
So instead of wishing you a love that burns, I wish you love like a river that twists and turns. 
It changes and flows. It is powerful and free. But it consistently finds its way back to the sea. 
And so, like the water, I hope your love is ever growing, ever changing. 
I hope your love is powerful and free. 
And may you always find each other, like the river finds the sea.

## Declaration of Intent

*(To couple:)* Please join hands. 

*(To Dan:)* Dan, do you take Jacqui to be your lawfully wedded wife to share your life with? Will you love her, laugh with her, comfort her, honor and defend her, and be true to her above all else?

*(Dan to Jacqui:)* I do.

*(To Jacqui:)* Jacqui, do you take Dan to be your lawfully wedded husband to share your life with? Will you love him, laugh with him, comfort him, honor and defend him, and be true to him above all else?

*(Jacqui:)* I do.

## Exchange of Rings

*(To guests:)* Couples have exchanged rings as a symbol of commitment to each other for thousands of years. With no beginning and no end, the circle is a symbol of eternity. Allow these rings to serve as a symbol of your love's history, present, and future.

*(To Jacqui:)* Jacqui, please repeat after me: *I give you this ring as a symbol of my undying love for you. With it, I promise to love you, cherish you, and stand by you in good times and bad, sickness and health, for as long as I live.*

*Jacqui places ring on Dan's finger*

*(To Dan:)* Dan, please repeat after me. *I give you this ring as a symbol of my undying love for you. With it, I promise to love you, cherish you, and stand by you in good times and bad, sickness and health, for as long as I live.*

## Salt Ritual (optional)

*(To guests):* Salt has been used as a preservative and purifier to prevent decay and corruption since ancient times. It is the symbol of God’s character and dependability because it is enduring, never changing, and abiding eternally. 

*(To couple):* Jacqui and Dan, a vial of salt stands before each of you, symbolizing your individuality as well as your dreams for this marriage and the family you have become. Blending your salt together is like sharing that dream, symbolizing your joining in marriage and as one family.

*(To couple):* Dan and Jacqui, at this time, I ask each of you to lift your vials of salt and blend them together.

*(To couple):* This salt exchange symbolizes the intertwining of your lives. Separating these grains of salt would be very hard, but coming between you would be even harder. No matter what life brings, this shared dream is an integral part of your journey through it.

## Pronouncement

*(To couple:)* At this time, I would like to share a wish for you both. My wish is you always find the Muppet-style optimism to love and care for each other and you continue to cultivate the support of your friends and family, which is as much a gift to us as we hope it is for you. May you be surrounded by the support and love shown here today for all the years to come, and may you always find each other, as that light for each other in dark places, when all other lights go out!

*(To couple:)* By the power vested in me by the Universal Life Church and the American Marriage Ministries, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss!
