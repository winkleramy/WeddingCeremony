# Wedding Ceremony for Jacqui Dodge and Daniel Winkler

#### General Questions
- Do you prefer to be referred to as "husband and wife", as "partners", or as "spouses"?
- Would you like any specific thank-yous or acknowledges made by me on your behalf at the beginning of the ceremony?
- Do you have any reading, poem, or song preference for the "reading" section of the ceremony? Who would you like to perform the reading?
- Would you like to combine the vows and ring exchange or keep them separate?
- Would you like to customize the vows and/or ring exchange wording?
- Would you like to specify who goes first for each section? By default, I'll alternate who goes first for the declaration of intent, vows, and rings.
- Would you like to include any extra rituals, such as a candle or salt ritual?

## Introduction and Welcome

*optional wedding crashers reference:* Welcome! If you're a Wedding Crashers fan and wondered what you like better, Christmas or Wedding Season, well, today is Dan and Jacqui's gift to you.

*to guests:* On behalf of Jacqui and Dan, thank you for being here today and for supporting them over the years. They have built a lasting and proven friendship, the kind of relationship we recognize today as a marriage. And as witnesses, we show our intent to support Dan and Jacqui for the years to come.

*to couple:* Dan and Jacqui, thank you for inviting us to celebrate the love that has grown between you, deeper and more meaningful as the years have gone by. The kind of partnership you have is built on more than love. I have seen the ever-expanding empathy, creativity, and the generous sense of humor that has gone into it and made it stronger. Besides watching The Wedding Crashers to prepare for today, I also resonated with this phrase from Kermit the Frog's TedX Talk. Loving relationships are built on a kind of ridiculous optimism, and it's the kind of dream that gets better the more people you share it with.

*to guests:* We will now have the reading.

## Reading

I want to make you smile whenever you're sad,
carry you around when your arthritis is bad.
All I want to do, is grow old with you.

I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches,
build you a fire if the furnace breaks.
Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you.

I'll miss you, kiss you, give you my coat when you are cold.
Need you, feed you, even let you hold the remote control.

So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink,
put you to bed if you've had too much to drink.
I could be the man, who grows old with you.
I want to be the man, who grows old with you.

## Declaration of Intent

*to couple:* Let's not leave this a cliff hanger! Please join hands. 

*To Dan:* Dan, do you take Jacqui to be your lawfully wedding wife to share your life with? Will you love her, laugh with her, comfort her, honor and defend her, and be true to her above all else?

*Dan to Jacqui:* I do.

*To Jacqui:* Jacqui, do you take Dan to be your lawfully wedded husband to share your life with? Will you love him, laugh with him, comfort him, honor and defend him, and be true to him above all else?

*Jacqui:* I do.

## Exchange of Rings

*To guests:* Couples have exchanged rings as a symbol of commitment to each other for thousands of years. With no beginning and no end, the circle is a symbol of eternity. Allow these rings to serve as a symbol of your love's history, present, and future.

*To Jacqui:* Jacqui, please repeat after me: *Dan, I give you this ring as a symbol of my undying love for you. With it, I promise to love you, cherish you, and stand by you in good times and bad, sickness and health, for as long as I live.*

*Jacqui places ring on Dan's finger*

*To Dan:* Dan, please repeat after me. *Jacqui, I give you this ring as a symbol of my undying love for you. With it, I promise to love you, cherish you, and stand by you in good times and bad, sickness and health, for as long as I live.*

## Pronouncement

*To couple:* At this time, I would like to share a wish for you both. My wish is you always find the strength to love and care for yourselves with radical empathy and ridiculous optimism and you continue to cultivate the support of your friends and family, which is as much a gift to us as we hope it is for you. No one person needs to be everything to us in all phases of our lives. May you be as surrounded by the support and love on display here today in all the years to come.

*To couple:* At that's it! By the power vested in me by the Universal Life Church Ministeries and the American Marriage Ministries, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss!
